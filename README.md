# Project Setup Instructions

## Initial Setup

1. **Download Files Individually**:
   Instead of downloading the entire repository as a ZIP from GitHub, please download each file individually into the same folder. This ensures that you select only the necessary files.

2. **Unzip Data File**:
   Unzip `data.zip` into the same folder. Make sure to only extract the necessary files.

## Data Preprocessing

3. **Run Data Preprocessing Script**:
   To process the data, run the R script for data preprocessing. Note that this requires Rtools version 43. You can download it from the following URL: [Rtools 43](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html).

## Run Application

4. **Execute Shiny Application**:
   Finally, run the `2 shiny new.R` file to start the application.

Please follow these steps carefully to ensure the application runs correctly.
